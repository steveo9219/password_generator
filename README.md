# password_generator

For this homework I was tasked with creating a password generator.

i first started off with the HTML and CSS elements for the page and wanted to be as identical to the example as possible

when the user clicked the button i wanted them to only have to answer prompts and then a password would _magically_ generate in the text box.

after asking some confirm prompts about cases preference and number and special characters, they would see their new password waiting for them in the textbox

_if_ {
their password didn't meet the requirements of 8-128 character count or added
a letter in the box;
} _else_ it would let them know "Your selections didn't meet the minimum requirements for a secure password!" and also would tell them in the textbox at the end of the prompts;
